Clock on Russian IN1 Indicators
Idea Nexie Clock

This project needs the Arduino IDE 1.7.5+
Arduino ProMini 5v
DS3231 Clock Module
FM Repiter 433 manual
Texas MC34063
& A few simple radio components (transistors, diodes and capacitors)

The 433 module is only needed to transfer the clock from my smart home system, you can just not put it on, but it's convenient for me.
